;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing Python, with support for inferior processes.

;; There is another Python mode, python-mode.el, used by XEmacs and
;; maintained with Python.  That isn't covered by an FSF copyright
;; assignment, unlike this code, and seems not to be well-maintained
;; for Emacs (though I've submitted fixes).  This mode is rather
;; simpler and is better in other ways.  In particular, using the
;; syntax functions with text properties maintained by font-lock makes
;; it more correct with arbitrary string and comment contents.

;; This doesn't implement all the facilities of python-mode.el.  Some
;; just need doing, e.g. catching exceptions in the inferior Python
;; buffer (but see M-x pdb for debugging).  [Actually, the use of
;; `compilation-shell-minor-mode' now is probably enough for that.]
;; Others don't seem appropriate.  For instance,
;; `forward-into-nomenclature' should be done separately, since it's
;; not specific to Python, and I've installed a minor mode to do the
;; job properly in Emacs 23.  [CC mode 5.31 contains an incompatible
;; feature, `c-subword-mode' which is intended to have a similar
;; effect, but actually only affects word-oriented keybindings.]

;; Other things seem more natural or canonical here, e.g. the
;; {beginning,end}-of-defun implementation dealing with nested
;; definitions, and the inferior mode following `cmuscheme'.  (The
;; inferior mode can find the source of errors from
;; `python-send-region' & al via `compilation-shell-minor-mode'.)
;; There is (limited) symbol completion using lookup in Python and
;; Eldoc support also using the inferior process.  Successive TABs
;; cycle between possible indentations for the line.

;; Even where it has similar facilities, this mode is incompatible
;; with python-mode.el in some respects.  For instance, various key
;; bindings are changed to obey Emacs conventions.

;; There is support for both Python 2 and Python 3 languages and
;; interpreters using the emacs.py module in inferior processes.

;; TODO: See various Fixmes below.

  "Major mode for editing Python 2.x files.
Supports the syntax and builtins of Python 2.6.

Turns on Font Lock mode unconditionally since it is currently required
for correct parsing of the source.
See also `jython-mode', which is actually invoked if the buffer appears to
contain Jython code.  See also `run-python' and associated Python mode
commands for running Python under Emacs.

The Emacs commands which work with `defun's, e.g. \\[beginning-of-defun], deal
with nested `def' and `class' blocks.  They take the innermost one as
current without distinguishing method and class definitions.  Used multiple
times, they move over others at the same indentation level until they reach
the end of definitions at that level, when they move up a level.
\\<python-mode-map>
Colon is electric: it outdents the line if appropriate, e.g. for
an else statement.  \\[python-backspace] at the beginning of an indented statement
deletes a level of indentation to close the current block; otherwise it
deletes a character backward.  TAB indents the current line relative to
the preceding code.  Successive TABs, with no intervening command, cycle
through the possibilities for indentation on the basis of enclosing blocks.

\\[fill-paragraph] fills comments and multi-line strings appropriately, but has no
effect outside them.

Supports Eldoc mode (only for functions, using a Python process),
Info-Look and Imenu.  In Outline minor mode, `class' and `def' lines
count as headers.

Symbol completion is available similarly to the `rlcompleter' module
in the Python shell.  This completion is added to the Hippie Expand
functions locally if Hippie Expand mode is turned on.  Completion of
symbols of the form x.y only works if the components are literal
module/attribute names, not variables.  An abbrev table is set up with
skeleton expansions for compound statement templates.  Turn on Abbrev
mode to use it.
