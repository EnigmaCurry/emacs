;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    This is a separate mode to implement the C# constructs and
;;    font-locking. It is based on the java-mode example from cc-mode.
;;
;;    Note: The interface used in this file requires CC Mode 5.30 or
;;    later.

;;; Bugs:
;;
;;   Literal strings @"" do not fontify correctly.
;;
;;   Method names are not fontified if you have an attribute before it.
;;
;;   This code doesn't seem to work when you compile it, then
;;   load/require in the emacs file. You will get an error (error
;;   "`c-lang-defconst' must be used in a file") which happens because
;;   cc-mode doesn't think it is in a buffer while loading directly
;;   from the init. However, if you call it based on a file extension,
;;   it works properly. Interestingly enough, this doesn't happen if
;;   you don't byte-compile cc-mode.

;;; .emacs (don't put in (require 'csharp-mode))
;; (autoload 'csharp-mode "csharp-mode" "Major mode for editing C# code." t)
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;    (append '(("\\.cs$" . csharp-mode)) auto-mode-alist))

;;; Versions:
;;
;;    0.1.0 - Initial release.
;;    0.2.0 - Fixed the identification on the "enum" keyword.
;;          - Fixed the font-lock on the "base" keyword
;;    0.3.0 - Added a regex to fontify attributes. It isn't the
;;            the best method, but it handles single-like attributes
;;            well.
;;          - Got "super" not to fontify as a keyword.
;;          - Got extending classes and interfaces to fontify as something.
;;    0.4.0 - Removed the attribute matching because it broke more than
;;            it fixed.
;;          - Corrected a bug with namespace not being properly identified
;;            and treating the class level as an inner object, which screwed
;;            up formatting.
;;          - Added "partial" to the keywords.
;;    0.5.0 - Found bugs with compiled cc-mode and loading from init files.
;;          - Updated the eval-when-compile to code to let the mode be
;;            compiled.
;;    0.6.0 - Added the c-filter-ops patch for 5.31.1 which made that
;;            function in cc-langs.el unavailable.
;;          - Added a csharp-lineup-region for indention #region and
;;            #endregion block differently.
;;    0.7.0 - Added autoload so update-directory-autoloads words
;;            (Thank you, Nikolaj Schumacher)
;;          - Fontified the entire #region and #endregion lines.
;;          - Initial work to get get, set, add, remove font-locked.

;; This is a copy of the function in cc-mode which is used to handle
;; the eval-when-compile which is needed during other times.
