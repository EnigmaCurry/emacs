;;; Commentary:

;;
;; Start with M-x anything, narrow the list by typing some pattern,
;; select with up/down/pgup/pgdown, choose with enter, left/right
;; moves between sources. With TAB actions can be selected if the
;; selected candidate has more than one possible action.
;;
;; Note that anything.el provides only the framework and some example
;; configurations for demonstration purposes. See anything-config.el
;; for practical, polished, easy to use configurations which can be
;; used to assemble a custom personalized configuration. And many
;; other configurations are in the EmacsWiki.
;; 
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/anything-config.el
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/AnythingSources
;;
;; Maintainer's configuration is in the EmacsWiki. It would tell you
;; many tips to write smart sources!
;;
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/RubikitchAnythingConfiguration

;; You can extend `anything' by writing plug-ins. As soon as
;; `anything' is invoked, `anything-sources' is compiled into basic
;; attributes, then compiled one is used during invocation.
;;
;; The oldest built-in plug-in is `type' attribute: appends
;; appropriate element of `anything-type-attributes'. Second built-in
;; plug-in is `candidates-in-buffer': selecting a line from candidates
;; buffer.
;;
;; To write a plug-in:
;; 1. Define a compiler: anything-compile-source--*
;; 2. Add compier function to `anything-compile-source-functions'.
;; 3. (optional) Write helper functions.
;;
;; Anything plug-ins are found in the EmacsWiki.
;;
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/AnythingPlugins

;;
;; Thanks to Vagn Johansen for ideas.
;; Thanks to Stefan Kamphausen for fixes and XEmacs support.
;; Thanks to Tassilo Horn for fixes.
;; Thanks to Drew Adams for various fixes (frame, isearch, customization, etc.)

;;; (@* "Index")

;;  If you have library `linkd.el', load
;;  `linkd.el' and turn on `linkd-mode' now.  It lets you easily
;;  navigate around the sections  Linkd mode will
;;  highlight this Index.  You can get `linkd.el' here:

;;; (@* "INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES")

;; v1.114
;;
;;   `anything-attr' returns nil when the source attribute is defined
;;   but the value of attribute is nil, eg. (volatile) cell. Use
;;   `anything-attr-defined' when testing whether the attribute is
;;   defined.

;;; (@* "Tips")

;;
;; `set-frame-configuration' arises flickering. If you hate
;; flickering, eval:
;; (setq anything-save-configuration-functions
;;    '(set-window-configuration . current-window-configuration))
;; at the cost of restoring frame configuration (only window configuration).

;;
;; `anything-delete-current-selection' deletes the current line.
;; It is useful when deleting a candidate in persistent action.
;; eg. `kill-buffer'.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-delete-current-selection)

;;
;; `anything-attr' gets the attribute. `anything-attrset' sets the
;; attribute. `anything-attr-defined' tests whether the attribute is
;; defined. They handles source-local variables.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-attr)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-attrset)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-attr-defined)

;;
;; `anything-sources' accepts many attributes to make your life easier.
;; Now `anything-sources' accepts a list of symbols.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-sources)

;;
;; `anything' has optional arguments. Now you do not have to let-bind
;; `anything-sources'.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything)

;;
;; `anything-resume' resumes last `anything' session. Now you do not
;; have to retype pattern.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-resume)

;;
;; `anything-execute-persistent-action' executes action without
;; quitting `anything'. When popping up a buffer in other window by
;; persistent action, you can scroll with `anything-scroll-other-window' and
;; `anything-scroll-other-window-down'. See also `anything-sources' docstring.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-execute-persistent-action)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-sources)

;;
;; `anything-select-2nd-action', `anything-select-3rd-action' and
;; `anything-select-4th-action' select other than default action
;; without pressing Tab.

;;
;; Using `anything-candidate-buffer' and the candidates-in-buffer
;; attribute is much faster than traditional "candidates and match"
;; way. And `anything-current-buffer-is-modified' avoids to
;; recalculate candidates for unmodified buffer. See docstring of
;; them.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-candidate-buffer)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-candidates-in-buffer)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-current-buffer-is-modified)

;;
;; `anything-current-buffer' and `anything-buffer-file-name' stores
;; `(current-buffer)' and `buffer-file-name' in the buffer `anything'
;; is invoked. Use them freely.
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-current-buffer)
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-variable 'anything-buffer-file-name)

;;
;; `anything-completing-read' and `anything-read-file-name' are
;; experimental implementation. If you are curious, type M-x
;; anything-read-string-mode. It is a minor mode and toggles on/off.

;;
;; Use `anything-test-candidates' to test your handmade anything
;; sources. It simulates contents of *anything* buffer with pseudo
;; `anything-sources' and `anything-pattern', without side-effect. So
;; you can unit-test your anything sources! Let's TDD!
;;
;; [EVAL IT] (describe-function 'anything-test-candidates)
;;
;; There are many unit-testing framework in Emacs Lisp. See the EmacsWiki.
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/UnitTesting
;;
;; There is an unit-test by Emacs Lisp Expectations at the tail of this file.

;; (@* "TODO")
;;
;;   - process status indication

  "The source of candidates for anything.
It accepts symbols:
 (setq anything-sources (list anything-c-foo anything-c-bar))
can be written as
 (setq anything-sources '(anything-c-foo anything-c-bar))
The latter is recommended because if you change anything-c-* variable,
you do not have to update `anything-sources'.

If you want to change `anything-sources' during `anything' invocation,
use `anything-set-sources', never use `setq'.

Attributes:

- name (mandatory)

  The name of the source. It is also the heading which appears
  above the list of matches from the source. Must be unique.

- header-name (optional)

  A function returning the display string of the header. Its
  argument is the name of the source. This attribute is useful to
  add an additional information with the source name.

- candidates (mandatory if candidates-in-buffer attribute is not provided)

  Specifies how to retrieve candidates from the source. It can
  either be a variable name, a function called with no parameters
  or the actual list of candidates.

  The list must be a list of strings, so it's the responsibility
  of the source to convert candidates to strings if necessary.

  If the candidates have to be retrieved asynchronously (for
  example, by an external command which takes a while to run)
  then the function should start the external command
  asynchronously and return the associated process object.
  Anything will take care of managing the process (receiving the
  output from it, killing it if necessary, etc.). The process
  should return candidates matching the current pattern (see
  variable `anything-pattern'.)

  Note that currently results from asynchronous sources appear
  last in the anything buffer regardless of their position in
  `anything-sources'.

- action (mandatory if type attribute is not provided)

  It is a list of (DISPLAY . FUNCTION) pairs or FUNCTION.
  FUNCTION is called with one parameter: the selected candidate.

  An action other than the default can be chosen from this list
  of actions for the currently selected candidate (by default
  with TAB). The DISPLAY string is shown in the completions
  buffer and the FUNCTION is invoked when an action is
  selected. The first action of the list is the default.

- type (optional if action attribute is provided)

  Indicates the type of the items the source returns. 

  Merge attributes not specified in the source itself from
  `anything-type-attributes'.

  This attribute is implemented by plug-in.

- init (optional)

  Function called with no parameters when anything is started. It
  is useful for collecting current state information which can be
  used to create the list of candidates later.

  For example, if a source needs to work with the current
  directory then it can store its value here, because later
  anything does its job in the minibuffer and in the
  `anything-buffer' and the current directory can be different
  there.

- match (optional)

  List of functions called with one parameter: a candidate. The
  function should return non-nil if the candidate matches the
  current pattern (see variable `anything-pattern').

  This attribute allows the source to override the default
  pattern matching based on `string-match'. It can be used, for
  example, to implement a source for file names and do the
  pattern matching on the basename of files, since it's more
  likely one is typing part of the basename when searching for a
  file, instead of some string anywhere else in its path.

  If the list contains more than one function then the list of
  matching candidates from the source is constructed by appending
  the results after invoking the first function on all the
  potential candidates, then the next function, and so on. The
  matching candidates supplied by the first function appear first
  in the list of results and then results from the other
  functions, respectively.

  This attribute has no effect for asynchronous sources (see
  attribute `candidates'), since they perform pattern matching
  themselves.

- candidate-transformer (optional)

  It's a function called with one argument when the completion
  list from the source is built. The argument is the list of
  candidates retrieved from the source. The function should
  return a transformed list of candidates which will be used for
  the actual completion.

  This can be used to transform or remove items from the list of
  candidates.

  The function can also substitute candidates in the returned
  list with (DISPLAY . REAL) pairs. In this case the DISPLAY
  string is shown in the Anything buffer, but the REAL one is
  used as action argument when the candidate is selected. This
  allows a more readable presentation for candidates which would
  otherwise be, for example, too long or have a common part
  shared with other candidates which can be safely replaced with
  an abbreviated string for display purposes.

  Note that if the (DISPLAY . REAL) form is used then pattern
  matching is done on the displayed string, not on the real
  value.

- filtered-candidate-transformer (optional)

  It has the same format as `candidate-transformer', except the
  function is called with two parameters: the candidate list and
  the source.

  This transformer is run on the candidate list which is already
  filtered by the current pattern. While `candidate-transformer'
  is run only once, it is run every time the input pattern is
  changed.

  It can be used to transform the candidate list dynamically, for
  example, based on the current pattern.

  In some cases it may also be more efficent to perform candidate
  transformation here, instead of with `candidate-transformer'
  even if this transformation is done every time the pattern is
  changed.  For example, if a candidate set is very large then
  `candidate-transformer' transforms every candidate while only
  some of them will actually be dislpayed due to the limit
  imposed by `anything-candidate-number-limit'.

  Note that `candidate-transformer' is run already, so the given
  transformer function should also be able to handle candidates
  with (DISPLAY . REAL) format.

  This option has no effect for asynchronous sources. (Not yet,
  at least.

- action-transformer (optional)

  It's a function called with two arguments when the action list
  from the source is assembled. The first argument is the list of
  actions, the second is the current selection.

  The function should return a transformed action list.

  This can be used to customize the list of actions based on the
  currently selected candidate.

- delayed (optional)

  Candidates from the source are shown only if the user stops
  typing and is idle for `anything-idle-delay' seconds.

- volatile (optional)

  Indicates the source assembles the candidate list dynamically,
  so it shouldn't be cached within a single Anything
  invocation. It is only applicable to synchronous sources,
  because asynchronous sources are not cached.

- requires-pattern (optional)

  If present matches from the source are shown only if the
  pattern is not empty. Optionally, it can have an integer
  parameter specifying the required length of input which is
  useful in case of sources with lots of candidates.

- persistent-action (optional)

  Function called with one parameter; the selected candidate.

  An action performed by `anything-execute-persistent-action'.
  If none, use the default action.

- candidates-in-buffer (optional)

  Shortcut attribute for making and narrowing candidates using
  buffers.  This newly-introduced attribute prevents us from
  forgetting to add volatile and match attributes.

  See docstring of `anything-candidates-in-buffer'.

  (candidates-in-buffer) is equivalent of three attributes:
    (candidates . anything-candidates-in-buffer)
    (volatile)
    (match identity)

  (candidates-in-buffer . candidates-function) is equivalent of:
    (candidates . candidates-function)
    (volatile)
    (match identity)

  This attribute is implemented by plug-in.

- search (optional)

  List of functions like `re-search-forward' or `search-forward'.
  Buffer search function used by `anything-candidates-in-buffer'.
  By default, `anything-candidates-in-buffer' uses `re-search-forward'.
  This attribute is meant to be used with
  (candidates . anything-candidates-in-buffer) or
  (candidates-in-buffer) in short.

- search-from-end (optional)

  Make `anything-candidates-in-buffer' search from the end of buffer.
  If this attribute is specified, `anything-candidates-in-buffer' uses
  `re-search-backward' instead.

- get-line (optional)

  A function like `buffer-substring-no-properties' or `buffer-substring'.
  This function converts point of line-beginning and point of line-end,
  which represents a candidate computed by `anything-candidates-in-buffer'.
  By default, `anything-candidates-in-buffer' uses
  `buffer-substring-no-properties'.

- display-to-real (optional)

  Function called with one parameter; the selected candidate.

  The function transforms the selected candidate, and the result
  is passed to the action function.  The display-to-real
  attribute provides another way to pass other string than one
  shown in Anything buffer.

  Traditionally, it is possible to make candidates,
  candidate-transformer or filtered-candidate-transformer
  function return a list with (DISPLAY . REAL) pairs. But if REAL
  can be generated from DISPLAY, display-to-real is more
  convenient and faster.

- cleanup (optional)

  Function called with no parameters when *anything* buffer is closed. It
  is useful for killing unneeded candidates buffer.

  Note that the function is executed BEFORE performing action.

- candidate-number-limit (optional)

  Override `anything-candidate-number-limit' only for this source.

- accept-empty (optional)

  Pass empty string \"\" to action function.

- dummy (optional)

  Set `anything-pattern' to candidate. If this attribute is
  specified, The candidates attribute is ignored.

  This attribute is implemented by plug-in.

- multiline (optional)

  Enable to selection multiline candidates.

  "Get candidates from the candidates buffer according to `anything-pattern'.

BUFFER is `anything-candidate-buffer' by default.  Each
candidate must be placed in one line.  This function is meant to
be used in candidates-in-buffer or candidates attribute of an
anything source.  Especially fast for many (1000+) candidates.

eg.
 '((name . \"many files\")
   (init . (lambda () (with-current-buffer (anything-candidate-buffer 'local)
                        (insert-many-filenames))))

+===============================================================+
| The new way of making and narrowing candidates: Using buffers |
+===============================================================+

By default, `anything' makes candidates by evaluating the
candidates function, then narrows them by `string-match' for each
candidate.

But this way is very slow for many candidates. The new way is
storing all candidates in a buffer and narrowing them by
`re-search-forward'. Search function is customizable by search
attribute. The important point is that buffer processing is MUCH
FASTER than string list processing and is the Emacs way.

The init function writes all candidates to a newly-created
candidate buffer.  The candidates buffer is created or specified
by `anything-candidate-buffer'.  Candidates are stored in a line.

The candidates function narrows all candidates, IOW creates a
subset of candidates dynamically. It is the task of
`anything-candidates-in-buffer'.  As long as
`anything-candidate-buffer' is used,`(candidates-in-buffer)' is
sufficient in most cases.

Note that `(candidates-in-buffer)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . anything-candidates-in-buffer)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
And `(candidates-in-buffer . func)' is shortcut of three attributes:
  (candidates . func)
  (volatile)
  (match identity)
The expansion is performed in `anything-get-sources'.

The candidates-in-buffer attribute implies the volatile attribute.
The volatile attribute is needed because `anything-candidates-in-buffer'
creates candidates dynamically and need to be called everytime
`anything-pattern' changes.

Because `anything-candidates-in-buffer' plays the role of `match' attribute
function, specifying `(match identity)' makes the source slightly faster.

To customize `anything-candidates-in-buffer' behavior, use search,
get-line and search-from-end attributes. See also `anything-sources' docstring.

value of the buffer's tick counter (see `buffer-modified-tick'), each
time text in that buffer is inserted or deleted.  By comparing the
values returned by two individual calls of `buffer-chars-modified-tick',
you can tell whether a character change occurred in that buffer in
between these calls.  No argument or nil as argument means use current
buffer as BUFFER."
