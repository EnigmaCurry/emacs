;;; Description:
;;
;;  This package provides a way to reuse the current dired buffer to visit
;;  another directory (rather than creating a new buffer for the new directory).
;;  Optionally, it allows the user to specify a name that all such buffers will
;;  have, regardless of the directory they point to.

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following to your
;;  ~/.emacs startup file
;;
;;     (require 'dired-single)
;;
;;  See below for key-binding suggestions.

;;; Usage:
;;
;;  M-x `joc-dired-single-buffer'
;;     Visits the selected directory in the current buffer, replacing the
;;     current contents with the contents of the new directory.  This doesn't
;;     prevent you from having more than one dired buffer.  The main difference
;;     is that a given dired buffer will not spawn off a new buffer every time
;;     a new directory is visited.
;;
;;     If the variable joc-dired-use-magic-buffer is non-nil, and the current
;;     buffer's name is the same as that specified by the variable
;;     joc-dired-magic-buffer-name, then the new directory's buffer will retain
;;     that same name (i.e. not only will dired only use a single buffer, but
;;     its name will not change every time a new directory is entered).
;;
;;     See below for key-binding recommendations.
;;
;;  M-x `joc-dired-single-buffer-mouse'
;;     Essentially this is the same as joc-dired-single-buffer, except that the
;;     action is initiated by a mouse-click instead of a keystroke.
;;
;;     See below for key-binding recommendations.
;;
;;  M-x `joc-dired-magic-buffer'
;;     Switch to an existing buffer whose name is the value of
;;     joc-dired-magic-buffer-name. If no such buffer exists, launch dired in a
;;     new buffer and rename that buffer to the value of
;;     joc-dired-magic-buffer-name.  If the current buffer is the magic buffer,
;;     it will prompt for a new directory to visit.
;;
;;     See below for key-binding recommendations.
;;
;;  M-x `joc-dired-toggle-buffer-name'
;;     Toggle between the `magic' buffer name and the `real' dired buffer
;;     name.  Will also seek to uniquify the `real' buffer name.
;;
;;     See below for key-binding recommendations.

;;; Recomended Keybindings:
;;
;;  To use the single-buffer feature most effectively, I recommend adding the
;;  following code to your .emacs file.  Basically, it remaps the [Return] key
;;  to call the joc-dired-single-buffer function instead of its normal function
;;  (dired-advertised-find-file).  Also, it maps the caret ("^") key
;;  to go up one directory, using the joc-dired-single-buffer command instead of
;;  the normal one (dired-up-directory), which has the same effect as hitting
;;  [Return] on the parent directory line ("..")).  Finally, it maps a
;;  button-one click to the joc-dired-single-buffer-mouse function, which does
;;  some mouse selection stuff, and then calls into the main
;;  joc-dired-single-buffer function.
;;
;;  NOTE: This should only be done for the dired-mode-map (NOT globally!).
;;
;;  The following code will work whether or not dired has been loaded already.
;;
;;      (defun my-dired-init ()
;;        "Bunch of stuff to run for dired, either immediately or when it's
;;         loaded."
;;        ;; <add other stuff here>
;;        (define-key dired-mode-map [return] 'joc-dired-single-buffer)
;;        (define-key dired-mode-map [mouse-1] 'joc-dired-single-buffer-mouse)
;;        (define-key dired-mode-map "^"
;;              (function
;;               (lambda nil (interactive) (joc-dired-single-buffer "..")))))
;;
;;      ;; if dired's already loaded, then the keymap will be bound
;;      (if (boundp 'dired-mode-map)
;;              ;; we're good to go; just add our bindings
;;              (my-dired-init)
;;        ;; it's not loaded yet, so add our bindings to the load-hook
;;        (add-hook 'dired-load-hook 'my-dired-init))
;;
;;  To use the magic-buffer function, you first need to start dired in a buffer
;;  whose name is the value of joc-dired-magic-buffer-name.  Once the buffer
;;  has this name, it will keep it unless explicitly renamed.  Use the function
;;  joc-dired-magic-buffer to start this initial dired magic buffer (or you can
;;  simply rename an existing dired buffer to the magic name).  I bind this
;;  function globally, so that I can always get back to my magic buffer from
;;  anywhere.  Likewise, I bind another key to bring the magic buffer up in the
;;  current default-directory, allowing me to move around fairly easily.  Here's
;;  what I have in my .emacs file:
;;
;;      (global-set-key [(f5)] 'joc-dired-magic-buffer)
;;      (global-set-key [(control f5)] (function
;;              (lambda nil (interactive)
;;              (joc-dired-magic-buffer default-directory))))
;;      (global-set-key [(shift f5)] (function
;;              (lambda nil (interactive)
;;              (message "Current directory is: %s" default-directory))))
;;      (global-set-key [(meta f5)] 'joc-dired-toggle-buffer-name)
;;
;;  Of course, these are only suggestions.

;;; Customization:
;;
;;  M-x `joc-dired-single-customize' to customize all package options.
;;
;;  The following variables can be customized:
;;
;;  o `joc-dired-use-magic-buffer'
;;        Boolean used to determine if the joc-dired-single functions should
;;        look for and retain a specific buffer name.  The buffer name to look
;;        for is specified with joc-dired-magic-buffer-name.
;;
;;  o `joc-dired-magic-buffer-name'
;;        Name of buffer to use if joc-dired-use-magic-buffer is true.  Once a
;;        dired buffer has this name, it will always keep this name (unless it's
;;        explicitly renamed by you).

;;; To Do:
;;
;;  o Nothing, at the moment.

;;; Credits:
;;
;;  The single buffer code is loosely based on code posted to the NT-Emacs
;;  mailing list by Steve Kemp & Rob Davenport.  The magic buffer name code
;;  is all mine.

;;; Comments:
;;
;;  Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are welcome.
;;  Please send them to Joe Casadonte (emacs@northbound-train.com).
;;
;;  This version of dired-single was developed and tested with NTEmacs 20.5.1
;;  and 2.7 under Windows NT 4.0 SP6 and Emacs 20.7.1 under Linux (RH7).
;;  Please, let me know if it works with other OS and versions of Emacs.
