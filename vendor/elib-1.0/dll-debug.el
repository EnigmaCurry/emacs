;;;
;;; A doubly linked list consists of one cons cell which holds the tag
;;; 'DL-LIST in the car cell and the list in the cdr 
;;; cell. The doubly linked list is implemented as a normal list. You
;;; should use dll.el and not this package in debugged code. This
;;; package is not written for speed...

;;; Code:
