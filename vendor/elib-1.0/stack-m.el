;;; Commentary:

;;; The stack is implemented as a linked list with a tag 'STACK
;;; as the first element.  All entries and removals are done using
;;; destructive functions.
;;;
;;; This file implements the functions as macros for speed in compiled 
;;; code.
;;;


;;; Code:

;; Provide the function version and remove the macro version
(provide 'stack-m)
