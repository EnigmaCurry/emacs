;;; Commentary:

;;;     Introduction
;;;     ============
;;;
;;; Cookie is a package that implements a connection between an
;;; dll (a doubly linked list) and the contents of a buffer.
;;; Possible uses are dired (have all files in a list, and show them),
;;; buffer-list, kom-prioritize (in the LysKOM elisp client) and
;;; others.  pcl-cvs.el uses cookie.el.
;;;
;;; A `cookie' can be any lisp object.  When you use the cookie
;;; package you specify a pretty-printer, a function that inserts
;;; a printable representation of the cookie in the buffer.  (The
;;; pretty-printer should use "insert" and not
;;; "insert-before-markers").
;;;
;;; A `collection' consists of a doubly linked list of cookies, a
;;; header, a footer and a pretty-printer.  It is displayed at a
;;; certain point in a certain buffer.  (The buffer and point are
;;; fixed when the collection is created).  The header and the footer
;;; are constant strings.  They appear before and after the cookies.
;;; (Currently, once set, they can not be changed).
;;;
;;; Cookie does not affect the mode of the buffer in any way. It
;;; merely makes it easy to connect an underlying data representation
;;; to the buffer contents.
;;;
;;; A `tin' is an object that contains one cookie.  There are
;;; functions in this package that given a tin extracts the cookie, or
;;; gives the next or previous tin.  (All tins are linked together in
;;; a doubly linked list.  The 'previous' tin is the one that appears
;;; before the other in the buffer.)  You should not do anything with
;;; a tin except pass it to the functions in this package.
;;;
;;; A collection is a very dynamic thing.  You can easily add or
;;; delete cookies.  You can sort all cookies in a collection (you
;;; have to supply a function that compares two cookies).  You can
;;; apply a function to all cookies in a collection, et c, et c.
;;;
;;; Remember that a cookie can be anything.  Your imagination is the
;;; limit!  It is even possible to have another collection as a
;;; cookie.  In that way some kind of tree hierarchy can be created.
;;;
;;; Full documentation will, God willing, soon be available in a
;;; Texinfo manual.



;;;     Coding conventions
;;;     ==================
;;;
;;; All functions that are intended for external use begin with one of
;;; the prefixes "cookie-", "collection-" or "tin-".  The prefix
;;; "elib-" is used for internal functions and macros.  There are
;;; currently no global or buffer-local variables used.
;;;
;;; Many function operate on `tins' instead of `cookies'.  To avoid
;;; confusion most of the function names include the string "cookie"
;;; or "tin" to show this.
;;;
;;; Most doc-strings contains an "Args:" line that lists the
;;; arguments.
;;;
;;; The internal functions don't contain any doc-strings.  RMS thinks
;;; this is a good way to save space.



;;; INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION (Your understanding of this package might
;;; increase if you read it, but you should not exploit the knowledge
;;; you gain. The internal details might change without notice).
;;;
;;; A collection is implemented as an dll (a doubly linked list).
;;; The first and last element on the list are always the header and
;;; footer (as strings). Any remaining entries are `wrappers'.
;;;
;;; At the implementation level a `tin' is really an elib-node that
;;; consists of
;;;      left        Pointer to previous tin
;;;      right       Pointer to next tin
;;;      data        Holder of a `wrapper'.
;;; These internals of an elib-node are in fact unknown to cookie.el.
;;; It uses dll.el to handle everything that deals with the
;;; doubly linked list.
;;;
;;; The wrapper data type contains
;;;      start-marker    Position of the printed representation of the
;;;                      cookie in the buffer. 
;;;      cookie          The user-supplied cookie.
;;;
;;; The wrapper is not accessible to the user of this package.

;;; Code:

(require 'dll)
(provide 'cookie)
