This file lists a number of things that should be done to the library
in the future.
================================================================

* Automated tests for the following files:
   - elib-node.el
   - avltree.el
   - bintree.el
   - string.el
   - read.el
   - dll.el
   - cookie.el

* Documentation of the automated test procedure

* Priority queue

* Debug variants of the container types which check everything on
  run-time.  This would be very slow but could also be a great help.
