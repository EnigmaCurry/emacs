Files in the directory are third party libraries.
These files should never be edited so as they can be updated whenever necessary.

All customizations should go in the parent directory.

Also, a few packages are way too big for me to want to replicate them on github, so I don't store them there and there is a post install procedure to get a few more packages. Run ./get-vendor-packages.sh
