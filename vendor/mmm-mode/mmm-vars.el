  "Which local variables to save for major mode regions.
Each element has the form \(VARIABLE [TYPE [MODES]]), causing VARIABLE
to be saved for all major modes in the list MODES.  If MODES is t or
absent, the variable is saved for all major modes.  MODES can also be
a function of no arguments which returns non-nil whenever the variable
should be saved.

TYPE should be either the symbol `global', meaning to save the
variable globally, the symbol `buffer', meaning to save it per buffer,
or the symbol `region', meaning to save it for each submode region.
If TYPE has any other value, such as nil, or is absent, the variable
is saved globally.  If all optional parameters are omitted, the
element may be simply VARIABLE instead of \(VARIABLE).

It is possible for VARIABLE to be not a symbol but a cons cell of the
form \(GETTER . SETTER), thus specifying special functions to set and
get the value of the \"variable\".  This is used for objects like
local maps, syntax tables, etc. which need to be installed in a
special way.  GETTER should be a function of no arguments, and SETTER
a function of one.  In this case, even if TYPE and MODES are omitted,
the list cannot be flattened--it must be \((GETTER . SETTER)).
\"Variables\" of this type cannot be seen with `mmm-get-saved-local'.

A single variable may appear more than once in this list, with
different modes and/or types.  If the same mode appears more than once
for the same variable with different types, the behavior is undefined.
Changing the value of this variable after MMM Mode has been activated
in some buffer may produce unpredictable results.

Globally saved variables are saved in the mmm-local-variables property
of the mode symbol.  Buffer saved variables are saved in the alist
`mmm-buffer-saved-locals'.  Region saved variables are saved in the
mmm-local-variables property of the overlay.")

(defvar mmm-classes-alist nil
  "Alist containing all defined mmm submode classes.
Each element looks like \(CLASS . ARGS) where CLASS is a symbol
representing the submode class and ARGS is a list of keyword
arguments, called a \"class specifier\". There are a large number of
accepted keyword arguments.

The argument CLASSES, if supplied, must be a list of other submode
classes \(or class specifiers), representing other classes to call.
FACE, if supplied, overrides FACE arguments to these classes, but all
other arguments to this class are ignored.

The argument HANDLER, if supplied, overrides any other processing. It
must be a function, and all the arguments are passed to it as
keywords, and it must do everything. See `mmm-ify' for what sorts of
things it must do. This back-door interface should be cleaned up.

The argument FACE, if supplied, specifies the display face of the
submode regions under decoration level 2.  It must be a valid face.
The standard faces used for submode regions are `mmm-*-submode-face'
where * is one of `init', `cleanup', `declaration', `comment',
`output', `special', or `code'.  A more flexible alternative is the
argument MATCH-FACE.  MATCH-FACE can be a function, which is called
with one argument, the form of the front delimiter \(found from
FRONT-FORM, below), and should return the face to use.  It can also be
an alist, each element of the form \(DELIM . FACE).

If neither CLASSES nor HANDLER are supplied, either SUBMODE or
MATCH-SUBMODE must be.  SUBMODE specifies the submode to use for the
submode regions, a symbol such as `cperl-mode' or `emacs-lisp-mode',
while MATCH-SUBMODE must be a function to be called immediately after
a match is found for FRONT, which is passed one argument, the form of
the front delimiter \(found from FRONT-FORM, below), and return a
symbol such as SUBMODE would be set to.  If MATCH-SUBMODE detects an
invalid match--for example a specified mode which is not `fboundp'--it
should \(signal 'mmm-no-matching-submode nil).

FRONT and BACK are the means to find the submode regions, and can be
either buffer positions \(number-or-markers), regular expressions, or
functions. If they are absolute buffer positions, only one submode
region is created, from FRONT to BACK. This is generally not used in
named classes. \(Unnamed classes are created by interactive commands
in `mmm-interactive-history').

If FRONT is a regexp, then that regexp is searched for, and the end of
its match \(or the beginning, if INCLUDE-FRONT is non-nil), plus
FRONT-OFFSET, becomes the beginning of the submode region.  If FRONT
is a function, that function is called instead, and must act somewhat
like a search, in that it should start at point, take one argument as
a search bound, and set the match data.  A similar pattern is followed
for BACK \(the search starts at the beginning of the submode region),
save that the beginning of its match \(or the end, if INCLUDE-BACK is
non-nil) becomes the end of the submode region, plus BACK-OFFSET.

FRONT-MATCH and BACK-MATCH default to zero.  They specify which
sub-match of the FRONT and BACK regexps to treat as the delimiter.
This number will be passed to any calls to `match-beginning' and
company.

FRONT- and BACK-OFFSET default to 0.  In addition to numbers, they can
also be functions to call which should move point to the correct
position for the beginning or end of the submode region.  Common
choices include `beginning-of-line' and `end-of-line', and new
functions can of course be written.  They can also be lists which will
be applied in sequence, such as \(end-of-line 1) meaning move to end
of line and then forward one character.

FRONT-VERIFY and BACK-VERIFY, if supplied, must be functions that
inspect the match data to see if a match found by FRONT or BACK
respectively is valid.

If SAVE-MATCHES is non-nil, BACK, if it is a regexp, is formatted by
replacing strings of the form \"~N\" by the corresponding value of
\(match-string n) after matching FRONT.

FRONT-FORM and BACK-FORM, if given, must supply a regexp used to match
the *actual* delimiter.  If they are strings, they are used as-is.  If
they are functions, they are called and must inspect the match data.
If they are lists, their `car' is taken as the delimiter.  The default
for both is \(regexp-quote \(match-string 0)).

The last case--them being a list--is usually used to set the delimiter
to a function.  Such a function must take 1-2 arguments, the first
being the overlay in question, and the second meaning to insert the
delimiter and adjust the overlay rather than just matching the
delimiter.  See `mmm-match-front', `mmm-match-back', and
`mmm-end-current-region'.

CASE-FOLD-SEARCH, if specified, controls whether the search is
case-insensitive. See `case-fold-search'. It defaults to `t'.

CREATION-HOOK, if specified, should be a function which is run
whenever a submode region is created, with point at the beginning of
the new region.  One use for it is to set region-saved local variables
\(see `mmm-save-local-variables').

INSERT specifies the keypress insertion spec for such submode regions.
INSERT's value should be list of elements of the form \(KEY NAME .
SPEC). Each KEY should be either a character, a function key symbol,
or a dotted list \(MOD . KEY) where MOD is a symbol for a modifier
key. The use of any other modifier than meta is discouraged, as
`mmm-insert-modifiers' is sometimes set to \(control), and other
modifiers are not very portable. Each NAME should be a symbol
representing the insertion for that key. Each SPEC can be either a
skeleton, suitable for passing to `skeleton-insert' to create a
submode region, or a dotted pair \(OTHER-KEY . ARG) meaning to use the
skeleton defined for OTHER-KEY but pass it the argument ARG as the
`str' variable, possible replacing a prompt string. Skeletons for
insertion should have the symbol `_' where point \(or wrapped text)
should go, and the symbol `@' in four different places: at the
beginning of the front delimiter, the beginning of the submode region,
the end of the submode region, and the end of the back delimiter.
