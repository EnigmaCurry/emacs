;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The code provides a abbreviation expansion for Emacs.  Its fairly
;; similar to "dabbrev" expansion, which works based on the contents
;; of the current buffer (or other buffers).
;;
;; Predictive abbreviation expansion works based on the previously
;; written text.  Unlike dynamic abbreviation, the text is analysed
;; during idle time, while Emacs is doing nothing else.  `pabbrev-mode'
;; tells you when this is happening.  If this irritates you unset
;; `pabbrev-idle-timer-verbose'.  The advantage of this is that its
;; very quick to look up potential abbreviations, which means that the
;; can be constantly displayed, without interfering with the user as
;; they type.  Certainly it works for me, on an old laptop, typing as
;; fast as I can (which is fast, since I learnt to type with four
;; fingers).
;;
;; pabbrev's main entry point is through the minor mode
;; `pabbrev-mode'.  There is also a global minor mode, called
;; `global-pabbrev-mode', which does the same in all appropriate
;; buffers.
;;
;; The current user interface looks like so...
;; 
;; p[oint]
;; pr[ogn]
;; pre[-command-hook]
;; pred[ictive]
;;
;; As the user types the system narrows down the possibilities.  The
;; narrowing is based on how many times the words have been used
;; previously.  By hitting [tab] at any point the user can complete the
;; word.  The [tab] key is normally bound to `indent-line'.
;; `pabbrev-mode' preserves access to this command (or whatever else
;; [tab] was bound to), if there is not current expansion. 
;;
;; Sometimes you do not want to select the most commonly occurring
;; word, but a less frequently occurring word.  You can access this
;; functionality by hitting [tab] for a second time.  This takes you
;; into a special suggestions buffer, from where you can select
;; secondary selections.  See `pabbrev-select-mode' for more
;; details. There is also an option `pabbrev-minimal-expansion-p'
;; which results in the shortest substring option being offered as the
;; first replacement.
;;
;; But is this actually of any use? Well having use the system for a
;; while now, I can say that it is sometimes.  I originally thought
;; that it would be good for text, but in general its not so
;; useful.  By the time you have realised that you have an expansion
;; that you can use, hit tab, and checked that its done the right
;; thing, you could have just typed the word directly in.  It's much
;; nicer in code containing buffers, where there tend to be lots of
;; long words, which is obviously where an abbreviation expansion
;; mechanism is most useful.
;;
;; Currently pabbrev builds up a dictionary on a per major-mode basis.
;; While pabbrev builds up this dictionary automatically, you can also
;; explicitly add a buffer, or a region to the dictionary with
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-buffer', or `pabbrev-scavenge-region'.  There is
;; also a command `pabbrev-scavenge-some' which adds some words from
;; around point.  pabbrev remembers the word that it has seen already,
;; so run these commands as many times as you wish.
;;
;; Although the main data structures are efficient during typing, the
;; pay off cost is that they can take a reasonable amount of time, and
;; processor power to gather up the words from the buffer.  There are
;; two main settings of interest to reduce this, which are
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-some-chunk-size' and
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-on-large-move'.  `pabbrev-mode' gathers text from
;; around point when point has moved a long way.  This means symbols
;; within the current context should be in the dictionary, but it can
;; make Emacs choppy, in handling.  Either reduce
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-some-chunk-size' to a smaller value, or
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-on-large-move' to nil to reduce the effects of
;; this.
;;
;; NOTE: There are a set of standard conventions for Emacs minor
;; modes, particularly with respect to standard key bindings, which
;; pabbrev somewhat abuses.  The justification for this is that the
;; whole point of pabbrev mode is to speed up typing.  Access to its
;; main function has to be on a very easy to use keybinding.  The tab
;; seems to be a good choice for this.  By preserving access to the
;; original tab binding when there is no expansion, pabbrev mostly
;; "does what I mean", at least in my hands.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; To install this file place in your `load-path', and add
;; 
;; (require 'pabbrev)
;;
;; to your .emacs

;;; Status:
;;
;; At the moment this seems to be working mostly, although
;; occasionally it seems to leave an expansion in the buffer.
;; I wrote this on an Emacs 21.0 prerelease, that I haven't upgraded
;; yet, running under RedHat 7.x. I've also tried this out on NT
;; Emacs (21.1), where it seems to byte compile, and work. But it has not
;; been tried out extensively. It will NOT work on Emacs' older than
;; 21.
;; 
;; This package now has an XEmacs maintainer (Martin Kuehl). He
;; appears to have isolated the last few problems with pabbrev on
;; XEmacs, and it is running stably there now. It has been tested on
;; XEmacs 21.4, running on Debian and Ubuntu Linux. 

;;; Bugs;
;;
;; This package had an occasional bug which has historically been hard
;; to track down and reproduce.  Basically I end up with a load of
;; offering expansions in the buffer. It looks something like this....
;; pabbrev[-mode][v][ev][rev][brev][bbrev][abbrev] which is amusing
;; the first time, but more or less totally useless.
;; 
;; Thanks to the efforts of Martin Kuehl, I think we have tracked the
;; cause of the problem now (the old version depended on
;; pre-command-hook and post-command-hook being called
;; consecutively. But sometimes they get called twice). Please let us
;; know if you see this problem. 

;;; Limitations:
;;
;; pabbrev mode has a number of common limitations.
;;
;; 1) I think it would be nice to save the dictionaries, or offer
;; facilities for doing so, before Emacs is killed. This would clearly
;; depend on point 3 also. I'm not sure whether this is possible in a
;; reasonable length of time. `pabbrev-debug-print-hashes' is
;; certainly pretty slow.
;;
;; 2) I think that the scavenge functions are more computationally
;; intensive than they need to be. They generally run in the idle
;; cycle so its not a disaster. However more efficiency would mean the
;; buffer could be gathered more quickly. This has the disadvantage
;; that I would have to start to think about...
;;
;; 3) There are current no facilities at all, for removing words from
;; the dictionaries. The original data structures, and in particular
;; the usage hash, were partly designed to support this. One way I
;; would do this is, for example, by just decreasing the number of
;; usages by a given amount, and then deleting (probably after the
;; sort during the scavenge), any cons cells with less than one
;; usage. I'm not sure this is a problem though. The number of words
;; in the dictionaries only increases slowly, then don't seem to grow
;; that quickly, and they don't take up that much memory. 


;;; Bug Reporting
;;
;; Bug reports are more than welcome. However one particular problem
;; with this mode is that it makes heavy use of
;; `post-command-hook'. This is a very useful hook, but makes the
;; package difficult to debug. If you want to send in a bug report it
;; will help a lot if you can get a repeatable set of keypresses, that
;; always causes the problem.

;;; Implementation notes:
;;
;; The core data structures are two hashes. The first of which looks
;; like this...
;; "the" -> ("the" . 5)
;; "there" -> ("there" . 3)
;; 
;; I call this the usage hash, as it stores the total number of times
;; each word has been seen.
;;
;; The second hash which is called the prefix hash. It stores
;; prefixes, and usages...
;;
;; "t"->
;; (("the" . 64)
;;  ("to" . 28)
;;  ("t" . 22)
;;  ("this" . 17))
;;
;; "th"->
;; (("the" . 64)
;;  ("this" . 17)
;;  ("that" . 7))
;;
;; "the"->
;; (("the" . 64)
;;  ("there" . 6)
;;  ("then" . 3)
;;  ("these" . 1))
;;
;; The alist cons cells in the first hash are conserved in the second,
;; but the alists are not. The alist in the second hash is always
;; sorted, on the basis of word usage.
;;
;; The point with this data structure is that I can find word usage
;; in constant time, from the first hash, and completions for a given
;; prefix, also in constant time. As access to completions happens as
;; the user types speed is more important here, than during
;; update, which is why the prefix hash maintains sorted alists. This
;; is probably at the cost of slower updating of words.

;;; Acknowledgements;
;;
;; Many thanks to Martin Kuehl for tracking down the last bug which
;; stood between this being an "official" full release.
;;
;; Once again I need to thank Stefan Monnier, for his comments on my
;; code base. Once day I will write a minor mode which Stefan Monnier
;; does not offer me advice on, but it would appear that this day has not
;; yet arrived!
;;
;; I should also thank Kim F. Storm (and in turn Stephen Eglen), as
;; the user interface for this mode has been heavily influenced by
;; ido.el, a wonderful package which I use every day.
