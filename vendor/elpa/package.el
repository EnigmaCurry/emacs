;;; Change Log:

;;  2 Apr 2007 - now using ChangeLog file
;; 15 Mar 2007 - updated documentation
;; 14 Mar 2007 - Changed how obsolete packages are handled
;; 13 Mar 2007 - Wrote package-install-from-buffer
;; 12 Mar 2007 - Wrote package-menu mode

;;; Commentary:

;; To use this, put package.el somewhere on your load-path.  Then add
;; this to your .emacs:
;;
;;    (load "package")
;;    (package-initialize)
;;
;; This will automatically make available the packages you have
;; installed using package.el.  If your .emacs will refer to these
;; packages, you may want to initialize the package manager near the
;; top.
;;
;; Note that if you want to be able to automatically download and
;; install packages from ELPA (the Emacs Lisp Package Archive), then
;; you will need the 'url' package.  This comes with Emacs 22; Emacs
;; 21 users will have to find it elsewhere.
;;
;; If you installed package.el via the auto-installer:
;;
;;    http://tromey.com/elpa/
;;
;; then you do not need to edit your .emacs, as the installer will
;; have done this for you.  The installer will also install the url
;; package if you need it.

;; Other external functions you may want to use:
;;
;; M-x package-list-packages
;;    Enters a mode similar to buffer-menu which lets you manage
;;    packages.  You can choose packages for install (mark with "i",
;;    then "x" to execute) or deletion (not implemented yet), and you
;;    can see what packages are available.  This will automatically
;;    fetch the latest list of packages from ELPA.
;;
;; M-x package-list-packages-no-fetch
;;    Like package-list-packages, but does not automatically fetch the
;;    new list of packages.
;;
;; M-x package-install-from-buffer
;;    Install a package consisting of a single .el file that appears
;;    in the current buffer.  This only works for packages which
;;    define a Version header properly; package.el also supports the
;;    extension headers Package-Version (in case Version is an RCS id
;;    or similar), and Package-Requires (if the package requires other
;;    packages).
;;
;; M-x package-install-file
;;    Install a package from the indicated file.  The package can be
;;    either a tar file or a .el file.  A tar file must contain an
;;    appropriately-named "-pkg.el" file; a .el file must be properly
;;    formatted as with package-install-from-buffer.

;; The idea behind package.el is to be able to download packages and
;; install them.  Packages are versioned and have versioned
;; dependencies.  Furthermore, this supports built-in packages which
;; may or may not be newer than user-specified packages.  This makes
;; it possible to upgrade Emacs and automatically disable packages
;; which have moved from external to core.  (Note though that we don't
;; currently register any of these, so this feature does not actually
;; work.)

;; This code supports a single package repository, ELPA.  All packages
;; must be registered there.

;; A package is described by its name and version.  The distribution
;; format is either  a tar file or a single .el file.

;; A tar file should be named "NAME-VERSION.tar".  The tar file must
;; unpack into a directory named after the package and version:
;; "NAME-VERSION".  It must contain a file named "PACKAGE-pkg.el"
;; which consists of a call to define-package.  It may also contain a
;; "dir" file and the info files it references.

;; A .el file will be named "NAME-VERSION.el" in ELPA, but will be
;; installed as simply "NAME.el" in a directory named "NAME-VERSION".

;; The downloader will download all dependent packages.  It will also
;; byte-compile the package's lisp at install time.

;; At activation time we will set up the load-path and the info path,
;; and we will load the package's autoloads.  If a package's
;; dependencies are not available, we will not activate that package.

;; Conceptually a package has multiple state transitions:
;;
;; * Download.  Fetching the package from ELPA.
;; * Install.  Untar the package, or write the .el file, into
;;   ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory.
;; * Byte compile.  Currently this phase is done during install,
;;   but we may change this.
;; * Activate.  Evaluate the autoloads for the package to make it
;;   available to the user.
;; * Load.  Actually load the package and run some code from it.

;;; ToDo:

;; - putting info dirs at the start of the info path means
;;   users see a weird ordering of categories.  OTOH we want to
;;   override later entries.  maybe emacs needs to enforce
;;   the standard layout?
;; - put bytecode in a separate directory tree
;; - perhaps give users a way to recompile their bytecode
;;   or do it automatically when emacs changes
;; - give users a way to know whether a package is installed ok
;; - give users a way to view a package's documentation when it
;;   only appears in the .el
;; - use/extend checkdoc so people can tell if their package will work
;; - "installed" instead of a blank in the status column
;; - tramp needs its files to be compiled in a certain order.
;;   how to handle this?  fix tramp?
;; - on emacs 21 we don't kill the -autoloads.el buffer.  what about 22?
;; - maybe we need separate .elc directories for various emacs versions
;;   and also emacs-vs-xemacs.  That way conditional compilation can
;;   work.  But would this break anything?
;; - should store the package's keywords in archive-contents, then
;;   let the users filter the package-menu by keyword.  See
;;   finder-by-keyword.  (We could also let people view the
;;   Commentary, but it isn't clear how useful this is.)
;; - William Xu suggests being able to open a package file without
;;   installing it
;; - Interface with desktop.el so that restarting after an install
;;   works properly
;; - Implement M-x package-upgrade, to upgrade any/all existing packages
;; - Use hierarchical layout.  PKG/etc PKG/lisp PKG/info
;;   ... except maybe lisp?
;; - It may be nice to have a macro that expands to the package's
;;   private data dir, aka ".../etc".  Or, maybe data-directory
;;   needs to be a list (though this would be less nice)
;;   a few packages want this, eg sokoban
;; - package menu needs:
;;     ability to know which packages are built-in & thus not deletable
;;     it can sometimes print odd results, like 0.3 available but 0.4 active
;;        why is that?
;; - Allow multiple versions on the server...?
;;   [ why bother? ]
;; - Don't install a package which will invalidate dependencies overall
;; - Allow something like (or (>= emacs 21.0) (>= xemacs 21.5))
;;   [ currently thinking, why bother.. KISS ]
;; - Allow optional package dependencies
;;   then if we require 'bbdb', bbdb-specific lisp in lisp/bbdb
;;   and just don't compile to add to load path ...?
;; - Have a list of archive URLs?  [ maybe there's no point ]
;; - David Kastrup pointed out on the xemacs list that for GPL it
;;   is friendlier to ship the source tree.  We could "support" that
;;   by just having a "src" subdir in the package.  This isn't ideal
;;   but it probably is not worth trying to support random source
;;   tree layouts, build schemes, etc.
;; - Our treatment of the info path is somewhat bogus
;; - perhaps have an "unstable" tree in ELPA as well as a stable one
